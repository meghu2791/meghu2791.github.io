Hello! Iâ€™m Meghana, a Ph.D student at [Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/){:target="_blank"} supervised by [Prof.Srinivasan Parthasarathy](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~parthasarathy.2/){:target="_blank"}. Last summer, I was a research intern at [MILA](https://mila.quebec/){:target="_blank"} under [Prof.Laurent Charlin](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~lcharlin/){:target="_blank"}. Previously, I graduated with masters at [UW-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/){:target="_blank"}. My research interests are in NLP, data mining and graphical models.
