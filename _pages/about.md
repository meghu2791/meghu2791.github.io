Hello! Iâ€™m Meghana, a second year masters student in [CS](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/){:target="_blank"} at [UW-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/){:target="_blank"}. I am fortunate to be working with [Prof. Theodoros Rekatsinas](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~thodrek/){:target="_blank"}. My current research interests are in data mining, NLP and graphical models.

Previously, I did my summer internship with the [Snapdragon Neural Processor Engine](https://developer.qualcomm.com/software/qualcomm-neural-processing-sdk){:target="_blank"} team at [Qualcomm Research](https://www.qualcomm.com/){:target="_blank"} in San Diego, CA. Before that, I was a senior software engineer at [Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html){:target="_blank"} in Bangalore, India. I did my undergrad in [CSE](https://sjce.ac.in/dept/cs/){:target="_blank"} at [SJCE](https://sjce.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}, India.
