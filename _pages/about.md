Hello! Iâ€™m Meghana, an incoming Ph.D student at [Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/){:target="_blank"}. Currently, I am a research intern at [MILA](https://mila.quebec/){:target="_blank"} under [Prof.Laurent Charlin](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~lcharlin/){:target="_blank"}. Previously, I graduated with masters at [UW-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/){:target="_blank"}. My research interests are in data mining, NLP and graphical models.

I did my summer internship in 2018 with [Snapdragon Neural Processor Engine](https://developer.qualcomm.com/software/qualcomm-neural-processing-sdk){:target="_blank"} team at [Qualcomm Research](https://www.qualcomm.com/){:target="_blank"} in San Diego, CA. Before that, I was a senior software engineer at [Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html){:target="_blank"} in Bangalore, India. I did my undergrad in [CSE](https://sjce.ac.in/dept/cs/){:target="_blank"} at [SJCE](https://sjce.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}, India.
